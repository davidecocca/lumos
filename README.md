## üåü Why Lumos?

Notion and other modern note apps are great, but they often tie your data to their cloud or are overloaded with features. **Lumos was born from a need for:**

- **True data ownership:** Your notes never leave your device unless you want them to.
- **Simplicity & speed:** Clean, minimal UI. Everything just works.
- **Local AI:** All AI features are local-first (and offline!), or you can use hosted models with your own keys.
- **Material-inspired Design:** A beautiful, distraction-free writing experience.


## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Electron** for cross-platform desktop experience
- **Vue 3** frontend (Material-inspired, minimal & clean)
- **SQLite** for storing notes
- **LanceDB** for fast local vector storage and search
- **LangChain** for AI/LLM integrations
- **Ollama** for local LLM/embeddings (plug-and-play local inference)
- **Optional:** Connect your own OpenAI (or similar) API key for hosted models


## üñ•Ô∏è Prerequisites

1. **Install [Ollama](https://ollama.com/download)**
2. Pull the `snowflake-arctic-embed2` embeddings model with:  
   ```bash
   ollama pull snowflake-arctic-embed2
   ```
    > This is needed to locally generate embeddings for your notes.
